Pose-Based Spatial-Frequency Attention GCNs for Interpretable Cerebral Palsy Prediction

Robust and interpretable early prediction by an automatic system is crucial and beneficial for effective intervention and treatment of cerebral palsy (CP). Clinical observations have shown that CP infants' movements are significantly different in both spatial-temporal and frequency domains. Therefore, we propose a novel two-stream Spatial and Frequency Attention based Graph Convolutional Network (SAFA-GCN) to fuse the spatial pose and the movement frequency features for robust CP prediction. We further propose a spatial attention module, a masked-frequency attention module, and a clipping-and-fusion method to improve model prediction accuracy and interpretability, facilitating the visualizations of significant human joints, frequency bands, and time range during CP prediction.
